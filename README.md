Problem Definition:

A production line balancing problem where we need to schedule activities in a single production line without double/parallel stations.

Input to the problem

Activity processing times are of type INTEGER only.

Precedence table.

Number of stations in the production line - K.

Required output:

Optimal/heuristic scheduling of activities to K stations that minimizes cycle time, i.e., maximizes production rate.
