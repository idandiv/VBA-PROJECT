# Production Line Balancing Project

## Overview
Simulation of a production line balancing problem using VBA in Excel. The goal is to optimize the assignment of tasks to minimize cycle time and maximize production rate.

## Components
- **VBA Macros**: Implement the logic for task assignment, cycle time calculation, and optimization.
- **Excel File**: Contains the task data, precedence constraints, and user interface for inputting parameters and running the simulation.
- **SQL Integration**: Stores and retrieves task data, logs results.

## Key Features
- **Task Assignment**: Assigns tasks to stations to minimize cycle time.
- **Optimization**: Uses heuristics to find near-optimal solutions for task scheduling.
- **User Interface**: Allows input of task times, number of stations, and precedence constraints.
- **Validation**: Ensures valid input and provides feedback to the user.

## How to Run
1. Open the Excel file with macros enabled.
2. Input task times, number of stations, and precedence constraints.
3. Run the macro to perform the task assignment and optimization.
4. Review the results displayed in the Excel file.

## Submission
- Include the Excel file with macros.
- Provide documentation and comments in the VBA code.
- Package the project directory into a ZIP file for submission.
